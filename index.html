<p>MAKE SOME LÖVE WITH LOVE MAKER</p>

<p>A simple distribution building script for your LÖVE games!</p>

<h2>
<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drop this project folder under the root directory of your LÖVE project.</li>
<li>Make sure that all of your code and resources are inside a directory named "src" under the root directory.</li>
<li>Make sure that the root directory of your project uses the actual name of your project.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are able to run bash scripts on your machine if you're on anything but Windows or powershell scripts if you are on Windows.</li>
<li>If the project is under a git repository, make sure to add "love-maker/" to your .gitignore file as well as "bin/" if you haven't already.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-to" class="anchor" href="#how-to" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How-to</h2>

<p>After having followed the appropriate setup requirements detailed above, to build your distributable LÖVE game, just run the love-maker.bat file if you are on Windows or the love-maker.sh file if you are on any other system.</p>

<p>The scripts prompt the user for some very basic things:</p>

<ul>
<li>What platform you want to build the distribution for

<ul>
<li>Options are Windows 64-bit, Windows 32-bit, Mac OS X, and Linux (not implemented yet)</li>
<li>Defaults to your running platform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a binaries folder already exists for the selected platform, whether you would like to simply update its build or clean and update

<ul>
<li>Clean removes the actual directory, so it's nice to use sometimes</li>
<li>Defaults to simple update</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you will be using these scripts for regular compiling while developing (that's what I do) and ALSO aren't in the habit of using a terminal, you may want to copy a shortcut of the script you are using into the binaries directory (or just use a terminal, you lazy ass).</p>

<ul>
<li>About the Windows scripts: I mentioned that powershell is required, but the script actually intended to be run is a batch file. There does exist a powershell script in the same directory (if you weren't observant enough to have noticed it yet), but there were some technical details which inclined me to make a batch file with the sole purpose of executing that powershell script. The powershell script actually does do all the work, but I like making things <em>double-clickable</em>. It just sits better with me that way.</li>
</ul>
