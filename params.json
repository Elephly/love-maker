There does exist a powershell script in the same directory (if you weren't observant enough to have noticed it yet), but there were some technical details which inclined me to make a batch file with the sole purpose of executing that powershell script. The powershell script actually does do all the work, but I like making things *double-clickable*. It just sits better with me that way.\r\n\r\n###### TODO\r\n- Implement Linux distribution\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
