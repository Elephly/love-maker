How-to
------

To build your LOVE2D game executable, place this folder into the
top of your project tree then run the "make.sh" file!

Before running the make script, it may be wise to open it in a
text editor and modify the source and binaries location variables.

Also, to make things easier for you and not invade your personal
bubble, I've made this all work from this directory, however, for
ease of use, you may want to create a shortcut to the "make.sh"
file and place that wherever you'd like.
